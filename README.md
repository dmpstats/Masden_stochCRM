#Stochastic Collision Risk Modelling (sCRM)

This repo is initialised with the code from Masden's (2015) work for marine scotland, which can be found here:
https://data.marine.gov.scot/dataset/developing-avian-collision-risk-model-incorporate-variability-and-uncertainty-r-code

## Motivation
The code is largely presented "as is", with no particular plan for improvement beyond non-trival bugs. This code formed the basis of further work in developing a user interface, as found here, albeit in markedly altered form:
https://www2.gov.scot/Topics/marine/marineenergy/mre/current/StochasticCRM

Fixes for some non-trivial bugs found in the course of the above work are propagated here to the Masden code, for parties interested in maintaining this, or using it for other works.
